# flickr-export

Export your Flickr account.

## Static website export

You can load up `index.html` as static website and save your Flickr account as a sequence of zip file archives.

## Electron App

The website also works as an [Electron app](https://electronjs.org/) allowing you to export your account as a `YYYY/MM/DD` folder hierarchy.

## Limitations

* Currently only works with an account's *public* photo stream
